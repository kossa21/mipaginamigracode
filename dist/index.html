<h1>What I like</h1>

<div class="container">
  <p>Being creative is not one of my strengths, for this reason I have always preferred to create the layout of websites, rather than creating contents or even creating code sometimes. But this is what life is about (at least for me), to <strong>get better day by day</strong> and <strong>face</strong> the things that are more difficult for us.<br><br>
    Let me tell you where my inspiration comes from: <strong><em>Anime!</em></strong></p>
  
  <h2>Anime</h2>
  
  <p>Yes, I know, those animated drawings made by Japanese people. Anime might seem the classic cartoon a child would watch, and not what you would watch as an adult, because us adults are very mature and we only see series and movies with real actors. </p>
  
  <p>But that's <em>not</em> my case.</p>
  
  <p>Many of these anime series have been one of my biggest sources of inspiration and motivation. I have seen some situations of my daily life reflected in some of these Anime series more than once, so, more than a childish recreation, they have been some kind of example for me to keep going and continue to reach my goals. </p>
  
  <h2>My favorite animes</h2>
  
  <p>I will list a few of my favorite series and characters:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Naruto</li>
    <li>My Hero Academia</li>
    <li>Black Clover</li>
    <li>Attack on Titan</li>
  </ul>
